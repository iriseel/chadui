                Mom, what year were you sent down to the countryside?
            </p>
            
            <p class="question hidden">
                How old were you?
            </p>
            
            <p class="question hidden">
                Where did you go?

            <p class="question hidden">
                How long were you there for?

            <p class="question hidden">
                What crops did you grow?

            <p class="question hidden">
                At the time, how did you feel about going “Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside”? 
                <br><br>
                Expectant? Anxious? Resigned?
            </p>
            
            <p class="question hidden">
                What is your clearest memory from that time?
            </p>
